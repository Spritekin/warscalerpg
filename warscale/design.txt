Architecture design

com.spritekin.warscale.utils
A package for all small tools that makes our life easier like string processors or javascript utilities.

com.spritekin.warscale.core
A package for all very core declarations. This defines the very central classes that will be extended or aggregated by other classes.
This includes:
- Expression - Text string that holds a value declaration, may be on the form of a function.
- Property - A expression that can be adjusted by other properties.
- WarscaleObject - All warscale objects inherit from this.
- ReferenceTable - A collection of objects.
- Library - All the tables.

Warscale objects
A warscale object is an entity made of properties and relations between objects. This is pretty much like class composition,
it contains a list of properties (with) and a list of mounted objects (has).
For example, a warrior with race human and with strength 3 has a sword.

A property is an inherent characteristic. A unique trait. For example people intelligence, hair colour, height, are properties.
Properties are declared as "[shared] name type value". If a property is shared, it will be assigned as an attribute for the parent object
when the object is mounted in another one.

Mounted objects are external factors the object gain. Like a warrior has a sword. Or has a high resistance to damage. Mounted
objects doesn't need to be physical, they can be skills or special abilities. They are marked with a level so it is only applied
if the main object reaches a certain level (or 0 if always).

Serialisation
- A warscale object can be serialised in order to save its state. 
- Only the owner of an object can alter the object. Other users can view the object at different power levels, but they can't
  modify it.
