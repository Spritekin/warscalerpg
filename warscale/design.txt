Architecture design

com.spritekin.warscale.utils
A package for all small tools that makes our life easier like string processors or javascript utilities.

com.spritekin.warscale.core
A package for all very core declarations. This defines the very central classes that will be extended or aggregated by other classes.
This includes:
- Expression - Text string that holds a value declaration, may be on the form of a function.
- Property - A expression that can be adjusted by other properties.
- WarscaleObject - All warscale objects inherit from this.
- ReferenceTable - Used to load a data table

Warscale objects
Warscale has 2 levels of objects, very similar to Java classes and instances. All of them use the WarscaleObject class.

Classes
- A warscale class is a declaration of a concept, for example a material or a race. A Warcale class does declare a latent relation between
  classes, for example a sword is made of steel, or a Medusa has a Flesh to stone gaze power. However those are just blueprints of objects.
  So it is possible to build a lot of steel swords from the same class.
- Classes are kept in the main warscale libraries which contains all the concepts.
- Relations of objects in the classes are timeless but can be marked with a minimum level which says when it should be applied.
- No effects are affecting a class. No need to keep track of time or reason for a effect.

Instances
- A warscale instance is an object that has been initialized from a class. An instance inherits all the properties from its base class.
- While an object may start with the same values as the blueprint, it may be embedded with specific characteristics and powers that make
  it quite unique. In a way, an instance is a unique class. It exists because it belongs to the world and must exist in a world.
- Worlds are unique and while they have a time frame it is not a "continuous" time. It is more like an event based time like a book.

Serialisation
- A warscale instance can be serialised in order to maintain its state. 
- A serialised instance keeps the history of all its changes as they level up. For example, a character keeps the history of when it gained levels,
  which skills were purchased with a level, etc.
- Only the owner of a character can alter the character. Other users can pick it at a level and use his abilities at that level, but they can't
  save the character.
